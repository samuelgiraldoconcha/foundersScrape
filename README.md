###To run the script:
1. Downlaod the repository.
2. Download the csv file with the founders keywords list (usually I download it from the residual sheet of the fundraising CRM). You can see the format in the file `template.csv`.
3. Place the name of the file in the variable: `csv_file_path = 'template.csv'`.
4. Run `dataEnrichmentScrape.py` in the terminal. Wait for the file to finish exporting the csv file.
